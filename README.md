# COGNIZANCE2020# pseudocode in c program
pseudocode is a description of the source code of a computer programor an algorithm in a language easily understood by humans.

It uses the general structure of a computer programming language,but omits details that are required by machines to execute the code.the primary purpose of writing pseudocode is to enable humans to understand the computer program or algorithm without having to understand the programming language.

pseudocode does not follow the syntax and grammar of any specific computer programming language . variable declarations are generally omitted.Function calls and blocks of code ,such as code for a loop ,are often replaced by a one-line natural language sentence.

# example
For I from 1 to 50:

Reads the for loop and prints all the integers from 1to50

set x=1

For I from 1to16:

print x

set x=x*2

The pseudocode outputs power of two .

define And(a,b) do 

if a then 

return  b 

end if 

return 0

end define 

The above pseudocode sample computes a logical and function
# GUIDE LINES FOR WRITING PSEUDOCODE

* write one statement per line

* capitalize initial keyword

* inded to hierarchy

* end multiline structure

 common keywords used in pseudocode

//: This keyword used to represent a comment

Begin,end: begin is the first statement and end is the last statement.

input,get,read : the keyword is used to inputting data.

The keywords should be used

keywords used are to be include do while...enddo;do until... enddo; case...end case ;if ....endif;call...with(parameters);call;return...;return;when;always use scope terminators for loops and iteration.


steps to follow is 

program start

initialise variable a=0

initialise variable b

start infinite loop

call function seg convert withinput a

seg convert returns value b

output b to led port

increment a

if a>g

a=0

call function delay for 500ms 

end infinite loop
